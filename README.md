# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API Solution

This is my solution to the REST Countries API challenge. I focused on creating a clean, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) using Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

## The Approach

### 1. State Management & SPA Logic
Instead of creating multiple HTML files, I used a **Conditional Rendering** approach. I wrapped the Home view and the Detail view in separate `div` containers. 
- When a user clicks a country, I hide the list and show the detail view.
- I used `cloneNode(true)` to efficiently generate the list of countries without writing repetitive HTML.

### 2. Handling Complex API Data
The REST Countries API v3.1 returns data in nested objects (like `currencies` and `nativeName`). Since the keys change (e.g., `USD` vs `EUR`), I used a dynamic approach to extract the values:
```javascript
// Dynamic extraction of currency name
currencies ? Object.values(currencies)[0].name : "N/A"
